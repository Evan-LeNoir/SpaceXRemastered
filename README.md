# Our Mission Statement
(1st Draft) SpaceX will be launching Starship sometime in 2020. What better way to celebrate it by giving a basic knowledge of our solar system.

The goal for this site is to give out simple details of our neighboring planets while flying by them. Not only will this site give out details about our neighboring planets, but also how long it will take to get there using SpaceX Starship.

We want to give out scientific and accurate information as possible. We'll provide a link to our resource in the descriptions as well.

[Doc notes & comments below]: # (DO NOT DELETE THIS! Anything below this is meant to be a place to keep comments and notation.
--Use the area below to add notes so that other team players can understand what is going on at all times.
--We can also use this as instructions to help guild a team member or the entire time. We'd do this by a 'To Do'. Example: For everyone/anyone 'Team - To Do' or to target a person 'Kole - To Do' or 'Evan - To Do' etc etc.
--How you notate in md is; open and closing brackets, colon, space, hash, space, parenthesis and within the parenthesis is where you put your message. End each note with a timestamp.)

[Kole - To Do]: # (Read over the User Guide of Starship and the Planets in our Solar System. Also make a wire frame of what the page for the planets will look like.)

[Assiting Memebers]: # (Under the assisting members section is where contributors will be listed. Anyone who helps with this project. Also add a hyperlink to their github {or other profile}. An example of how this is done is demonstrated above. 6/19/2020)

[Evan - To Do]: # (Look over the first draft and tell me what you think. I know it needs some work and to make it nicer.)

[Changelog]: # (This will not need to be populated yet and will only contain details that a user/visitor to your site would be concerned with; not backend things. This can be stuff like 'improved load times', 'added <insert feature here>', 'revamped the UI to be streamlined' etc etc. Do not concern yourself with this just yet. Once the site is finished, deployed and sustaining a following, that's when changelog can begin to be populated. 6/19/2020)
