# Our Mission Statement
Space X will soon launch project Starship in an attempt to begin colonizing Mars and explore our knowledge of Sol (Our Solar System).

This site will act as a resource of information as it becomes available, not just from Space X but from other credible sources as well. Only accurate information will be listed here with all of our resources available for accurate verification.

[The notation has been deleted]: # (I've updated the mission statement to make it short and catchy as possible. 6/23/2020 10:44AM.)

[Doc notes & comments below]: # (DO NOT DELETE THIS! Anything below this is meant to be a place to keep comments and notation.
--Use the area below to add notes so that other team players can understand what is going on at all times.
--We can also use this as instructions to help guild a team member or the entire time. We'd do this by a 'To Do'. Example: For everyone/anyone 'Team - To Do' or to target a person 'Kole - To Do' or 'Evan - To Do' etc etc.
--How you notate in md is; open and closing brackets, colon, space, hash, space, parenthesis and within the parenthesis is where you put your message. End each note with a timestamp.)

[Assiting Memebers]: # (Under the assisting members section is where contributors will be listed. Anyone who helps with this project. Also add a hyperlink to their github {or other profile}. An example of how this is done is demonstrated above. 6/19/2020)

[Changelog]: # (This will not need to be populated yet and will only contain details that a user/visitor to your site would be concerned with; not backend things. This can be stuff like 'improved load times', 'added <insert feature here>', 'revamped the UI to be streamlined' etc etc. Do not concern yourself with this just yet. Once the site is finished, deployed and sustaining a following, that's when changelog can begin to be populated. 6/19/2020)

[Kole - To Do]: # (Need to write a first draft for Starship, Earth and possibly another planet. 6/23/2020)

[Kole - Completed]: # (Completed a wire frame for the planet/spacex. Made a new folder called Resources, where a jpeg of the wireframe is saved. I've also downloaded the user guide for the Starship. 6/23/2020 10:58AM)
